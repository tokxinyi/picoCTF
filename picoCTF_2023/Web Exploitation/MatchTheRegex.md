## Hints
1. Access the webpage and try to match the regular expression associated with the text field

## Approach
1. Access the page, right click to Inspect Element
2. Under **Sources**, there is a function called `send_request()`. In that request, there is a comment specifying the regex of the correct value.

3. `^p.....F!?`

    - This pattern states that the string should start with `p` and end with `F`
    - In between, there will be 5 characters
    - First thought when I see the pattern is `picoCTF`
4. Input the string into the dialog box and the flag will appear.
